    be used throughout the webpage

  - **Color scheme**: variations of the base color to be used on
    specific elements of the webpage

  - **Understand the psychology behind colors:**

    - Red is a great color to use when power, passion, strength and
      excitement want to be transmitted. Brighter tones are more
      energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.

    - Orange draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It
      means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with
      friendliness, confidence, and courage.

    - Yellow is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and
      liveliness. Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence,
      brightness, etc.

    - Green is the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it
      is often associated with money. In design, green can have a
      balancing and harmonizing effect.

    - Blue means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is
      one of the most beloved colors, especially by men. It is
      associated with professionalism, trust and honor. That's actually
      why the biggest social networks use blue.

    - Purple is traditionally associated with power, nobility and
      wealth. In your design, purple can give a sense of wisdom,
      royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.

    - Pink expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.

    - Brown is the color of relaxation and confidence. Brown means
      earthiness, nature, durability, comfort, and reliability.
